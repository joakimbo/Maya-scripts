#### joakimJointOrient.py

This script allows a Maya user to create a GUI where he/she can

* Show and Hide the Local Rotation Axes for joints
(can propagate to children in hierarchy)
* Freeze rotation so that Rotate values become Joint Orient values
* Zero out Rotate and Rotate Axis values.
* Aim parent joint towards child according to aim, up and world up settings.
If several children are available user can choose to aim at one child or an average of all
(can propagate to children in hierarchy).
* Add and subtract from Joint Orient values.
